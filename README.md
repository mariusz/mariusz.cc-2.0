# mariusz.cc-2.0

**⚠️ WARNING: Here be dragons! ️️️️⚠️** 

In the spirit of building in the open, here you'll find all the code that goes
into generating new version of [mariusz.cc](http://mariusz.cc).

This is a heavily work-in-progress minefield. The idea is to finally update my website
with something worthy of 2017, but also try and fail at all
sorts of cutting edge stuff here. For now, I've decided on `styled-components`, to 
build the website as components and tightly couple styling
with the components, and React and Gatsby to generate the website itself.

A lot of things will and do break and this is far from done. For now, it's just
testing how far can I push the toolset, without paying much attention to the content.

If you're brave or fluent in React ways, feel free to fork, suggest improvements
as pull requests and throw discussions in the issues. You can also
[ask stuff on Twitter](http://twitter.com/dotmariusz), which I generally check
more often than Github issues.

Have fun!
